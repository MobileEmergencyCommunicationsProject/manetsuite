QNormTransport classes
====

The qnormtransport project is a collection of classes that adapt the
NORM protocol and its event-oriented API to the Qt way of programming.

QNormTransport is the base class.
QNormFileTransport is for NORM file data.
QNormTransportStream is for NORM stream data.

Each of these classes need to be documented.  Until that happens,
please look for examples of their use in the test programs in
../qnormtransporttest and ../mping.
